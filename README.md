# Getting-Started-with-Flutter

Before getting started with flutter, we first understand about flutter.  
Flutter is a **Software Development Kit** that is used to build cross-platform applications.  
The first alpha version of Flutter was released in May 2017.

## What is Flutter?

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is an **open-source framework** by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.  
- Flutter is *not a language*; it is an **SDK**.  
- Flutter apps use the Dart programming language for creating an app.  

  **Q. How does Flutter provide natively compiled applications?**
  Flutter uses Dart programmong language which provides support for native applications development.
  
## What is Dart?
Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.  
It is free and open source, developed by Google in 2011.

1. **Optimized for UI:**
 - Mature and complete async-await for user interfaces containing event-driven code, paired with isolate-based concurrency
 - A programming language optimized for building user interfaces with features such as sound null safety, the spread operator for expanding collections, and collection if for customizing UI for each platform
 - A programming language that is easy to learn, with a familiar syntax.

2. **Productive Development:** 
  - Make changes to your source code iteratively, using hot reload to instantly see the effect in the running app
  - Write code using a flexible type system with rich static analysis and powerful, configurable tooling
  - Do profiling, logging, and debugging with your code editor of choice.

3. **Fast on all platforms:** 
  - AOT-compile apps to native machine code for instant startup
  - Target the web with complete, mature, fast compilers for JavaScript
  - Run backend code supporting your app, written using a single programming language.
