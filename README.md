# Getting-Started-with-Flutter
Before getting started with flutter, we first understand about flutter.
## What is Flutter?
- Flutter is an open-source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.  
- Flutter is *not a language*; it is an **SDK**. Flutter apps use the Dart programming language for creating an app.  
- The first alpha version of Flutter was released in May 2017.
